# Formula uOttawa's Data Analysis Tool
**What this project is**

This repository contains a custom analysis toolkit that connects to the team’s data sources to generate reusable plots, metrics, and reports tailored to FSAE needs. It is designed to be lightweight and easy for team members to run, modify, and extend as the car and sensors evolve over the season.

​
**Why build our own tools**

Off‑the‑shelf software that integrates with the ECU and dash (such as RaceStudio3) is powerful, but it hides much of the implementation and limits how deeply the team can experiment with custom analysis workflows. Building an in‑house toolkit aligns with the core FSAE goal of learning how systems work by designing and implementing them, rather than only configuring commercial solutions.

​
**Learning focus for new members**

This project is also a training ground for new software sub‑team members to learn modern software development practices in the context of real telemetry and performance questions. Contributors gain experience in data engineering, numerical analysis, and visualization while shipping tools that the rest of the team uses on a regular basis.

## Setup
First, download and install the [Anaconda installer](https://www.anaconda.com/download), this will allow you to organize the libraries we use. Then, open Anaconda prompt (as administrator) and set up a new environment with the following command:

`conda create --name FSAEDataGUI python=3.8`

Then, activate the environment using:

`conda activate FSAEDataGUI`

Once activated, you can begin installing the necessary libraries using:

`conda install [libraryName]` and `pip install [libraryName]`

List of libraries:
* [dearpygui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) (pip)
* numpy (conda)
* pandas (conda)

Then, verify your dearpygui installation by running the following command:

`python -m dearpygui.demo`

You should see a demo program showing off the features. You can now install Git and your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) to contribute to the software! Make sure to set your environment to FSAEDataGUI in the IDE. You should also be familiar with using branches and making pull requests on Git, you can find many good tutorials on YouTube. We recommend using (GitHub Desktop)[https://desktop.github.com/download/] and (VSCode)[https://code.visualstudio.com/].
